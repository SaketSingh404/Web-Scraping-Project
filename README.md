# 📚 Book Data Scraper & EDA

This repository contains a Python project that scrapes a book website containing 1000 books, extracts relevant information from individual book pages, and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Web Scraping:** Collected data from a book listing website where each book has its own dedicated page.
- **Extracted Features:**
  - Book Name
  - Genre/Category
  - Rating
  - Stock Availability
- **EDA:** Cleaned and analyzed the dataset using Python libraries to uncover patterns and insights in the data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `jupyter notebook` for step-by-step analysis

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA

Some of the insights discovered during analysis include:

- Distribution of books across different genres
- Average ratings per genre
- Stock availability trends
- Correlation between rating and stock or other features
